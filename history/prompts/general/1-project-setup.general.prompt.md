I've created the history directory structure and located where history and memory are stored in your project. History will be stored in C:\\Users\\AG Computer\\Desktop\\hackthon_2_todo\\history\\prompts\\ and memory in C:\\Users\\AG Computer\\Desktop\\hackthon_2_todo\\.specify\\memory\\constitution.md. I've also explained the project structure including constitution, specs, plan, and tasks locations.
